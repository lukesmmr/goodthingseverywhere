## About
-----

This is my personal website and portfolio.
I'm a nomadic web developer travelling the world designing and developing online work.


## Some stuff I use
-----------------

* Roots
* Options Framework Plugin
* CMB2 Plugin
* Wordpress SEO Plugin
* Grunt
* Typekit
* Disqus for Comments
* Bootstrap Select
* Google Maps API v3.0

## Theme Development

After you've installed Grunt and ran `npm install`, use `grunt watch` to watch or `grunt build` to output minified files.
